This was my first project after getting back into front-end web development. I have redux setup for the backend in case I want to pass around data. I used Framer-Motion to apply animations to the website. This package has been great to work with. The more time I spend with it, the more I like it. Styled components are probably an overkill for a project this small. I used styled components because it is used a lot in the industry and I wanted to become familar with it. ",

I used Tailwind CSS for styling. Audacity is a program I used to clip sounds from the show. Getting the audio has been the most time consuming part of the project and I intend to add more as time goes. I found an NPM package called useSound to handle the audio clips. It is a wonderful package and I will use it again the future.",
